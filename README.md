# Online Learning System - Spring MVC & JPA

Welcome to the Online Learning System repository! This project is designed for learner who are learning to build web applications using Spring MVC and JPA (Java Persistence API). It serves as a simple yet comprehensive example of how to create a basic online learning platform where users can manage courses, enroll in classes, and track their progress.
Honestly, the code was writing using chatGPT. :)

## Features

- User Management: Register, login, and manage user profiles.
- Course Management: Create, update, and delete courses.
- Enrollment System: Users can enroll in courses and track their progress.
- Database Integration: Uses JPA for database operations with Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.
- MVC Architecture: Follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern for clean and maintainable code.

## Technologies Used

- Spring MVC: For building the web application.
- JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For database operations.
- Hibernate: As the ORM tool.
- MySQL: As the database (can be replaced with any other relational database).
- Maven: For dependency management.
- Bootstrap: For front-end styling.
